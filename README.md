This project presents an AI-based approach for USD/TRY exchange rate forecasting.

It has been demonstrated that deep learning techniques (RNN-LSTM) can be used effectively in the analysis of time series data.

The model was trained on exchange rate data between 01-01-2020 and 03-01-2025 and predictions were made.

Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna increased the performance of the model and improved the prediction accuracy.

The model's ability to make both historical data-based predictions and future price prediction capacity shows that it offers a viable solution in financial markets.
